    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let a = 1;
    let b = a;
    b = 5;
    console.log(a, b);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[0] = 'John';
    console.log(team, players);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = Array.from(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[0] = 'John';
    console.log(team4, players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const dev = person;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const dev1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 30, job: 'web developer'});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // Poor man's cloneDeep
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
